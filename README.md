# hello-world
My first step into Github. Wish me luck
I am a 20 year old Media and Entertainment student living in the Netherlands. 
While my main interest lays within the field of film, video games always have had a big impact on my life. For this reason I want to be able to persue projects in this realm next to my eventual (hopefully) career in the film industry.
